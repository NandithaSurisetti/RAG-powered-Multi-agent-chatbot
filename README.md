# RAG-Powered Multi-Agent Q&A Assistant

This project is a **RAG-Powered (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** multi-agent Q&A Assistant that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and integrates various tools to provide accurate and context-aware answers to user queries.

The application is built using the LangChain framework and deployed using Streamlit, providing users with a simple and interactive interface to ask questions and retrieve information from external sources such as LangSmith documentation and Wikipedia.

---

## Features

1. **Wikipedia Integration**:
   - Queries Wikipedia to fetch concise and accurate information.
   - Uses LangChain's `WikipediaQueryRun` tool.

2. **LangSmith Documentation Search**:
   - Leverages FAISS for retrieval-augmented search over LangSmith documentation.
   - Allows users to ask detailed and specific questions about LangSmith.

3. **OpenAI GPT-3.5**:
   - Utilizes GPT-3.5 (via the `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` model) as the primary language model.
   - Provides high-quality natural language responses.

4. **Dynamic Toolset**:
   - Combines multiple tools for query resolution.
   - Automatically selects the appropriate tool based on the query content.

5. **Streamlit Interface**:
   - Simple and user-friendly web interface.
   - API key encrypted input field for secure usage.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**:
   - The user enters their OpenAI API key and a query through the Streamlit interface.

2. **Tool Selection**:
   - The application dynamically selects the appropriate tool based on the query:
     - Wikipedia for general knowledge queries.
     - LangSmith-specific retriever for LangSmith-related questions.

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Uses the relevant tool to retrieve data and process the query.
   - Generates a natural language response via GPT-3.5.

4. **Output Display**:
   - Displays the final answer along with details about the tool used.
   - For LangSmith-related queries, retrieved documents are also shown.

## Usage

1. **Enter OpenAI API Key**:
   - The application requires an OpenAI API key for GPT-3.5 integration.
   - Enter the key securely in the password input field.

2. **Ask a Question**:
   - Type a query in the input box, and the system will process it using the appropriate tool.
   - Receive an answer dynamically generated by GPT-3.5.

3. **Supported Query Types**:
   - **General Knowledge**: Queries are answered using Wikipedia.
   - **LangSmith-Specific**: Questions about LangSmith are answered using the retriever tool.

---

## Example Usage

### General Knowledge Query:
- **Input**: "What is artificial intelligence?"
- **Tool Used**: Wikipedia
- **Output**: A concise explanation of artificial intelligence fetched from Wikipedia.

### LangSmith Query:
- **Input**: "How do I use LangSmith for prompt evaluation?"
- **Tool Used**: LangSmith Retriever
- **Output**: A detailed explanation with references to LangSmith documentation.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `faiss` not installed
Ensure FAISS is correctly installed:
```bash
pip install faiss-cpu
```

### Error: `OpenAI API key missing`
Make sure to provide a valid OpenAI API key in the application.
